 produce and USE a ton of information. What about the times before our age? A few decades ago there were no opportunities like these days. There was no method to store the data efficiently but it doesn’t mean that knowledge from the past should pass. That’s why we have developed a platform to stop the old information from vanishing completely.

## What it does
charpie is a platform which scan, store, index and share the data from the many newspapers and magazines. It’s a powerful tool to make unobtainable data accessible to everyone in the most convenient way. We believe that our platform can help people do more accurate research and make it easier for our humanity to learn from the past.

*Back-end Infra*: Python, Django (server)
*Content Extraction*: OpenCV, PyTesseract, PDFminer
*Search Engine*: Whoosh
